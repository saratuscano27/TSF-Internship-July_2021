# The Sparks Foundation Internship July_2021
# Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
Percentage scores of the students are predicted based on the number of hours spent on studying using Supervised Machine Learning.

# Algorithms used :
Linear Regression

# Dependencies:
Python<br>
Numpy<br>
Pandas<br>
Sklearn<br>
Matplotlib<br>
Seaborn<br>


# Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised Machine Learning
Predicting the optimum number of clusters and representing it visually using clustering techniques for the ‘Iris’ dataset.
# Clustering :
The method to segregate data into differnt groups, on basis of having similar characteristics, is called 'Clustering'.The groups that are formed are known as 'Clusters'.Clustering is used in Unsupervised Learning  as it can segregate multivariate data into various groups ,without any supervisor, on the basis of common characteristics of data. 
# Algorithms used: <br>
K-means 
# K-means Clustering:
- This technique segregates unlabeled data into various groups called clusters.<br>
- It is an iterative algorithm that divides a group of n datasets into k clusters based on the similarity and their mean distance from the centroid of that particular cluster formed.

# Dependencies:
Python<br>
Numpy<br>
Pandas<br>
Sklearn<br>
Matplotlib<br>
